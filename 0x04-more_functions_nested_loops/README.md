# More functions, more nested loops

This project was carried out during **ALX School** **Full Stack Software Engineering Studies**. The goal is to understand nested loops in **C language**.

## technology
* C files compiled with `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## files
All of the following files are programs written in C language:

| file name | description |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `0-isupper.c` | Check for uppercase letters |
| `1-actdigit.c` | test digits ("0" to "9")|
| `2-mul.c` | Multiply two integers |
| `3-print_numbers.c` | Print numbers from "0" to "9" |
| `4-print_most_numbers.c` | Print numbers from "0" to "9", except "2" and "4" |
| `5-number_more.c` | print the number 10 times, from "0" to "14" |
| `6-print_line.c` | Draw a line in the terminal |
| `7-print_diagonal.c` | Draw a diagonal line in the terminal |
| `8-print_square.c` | Print a square |

| `9-fizz_buzz.c` | Prints Fizz-Buzz test |
| `10-print_triangle.c` | Prints a triangle |
| `100-prime_factor.c` | Finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143` |
| `101-print_number.c` | Prints an integer |
