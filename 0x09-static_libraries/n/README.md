# 0x09-static_libraries Project #
General
What is a static library, how do you make one, and how do you use one?

basics of ranlib, ar, and nm

NOTE: Every file in this folder has been made executable.

The following problems are resolved by this project:

(./libholberton.a): Building a static library with each of the aforementioned functions.

File [Holberton]" .h]
All the aforementioned functions developed from earlier projects are contained in (./holberton.h).
â€“ The steps for making a static library.
-
To create our object files, or ".o" files, first compile all of the ".c" files.
'gcc -c *c'
- Using our object files, we then construct our static library.
"ar rc libholberton."
- After that, we verify that our static library was correctly constructed.
A.R.T. Libholberton
- We check to see if our object files were correctly connected.
libholberton.h, nm
- Build our static library's main code as follows to test it:
main.c gcc -std=gnu89
L. Holberton, "quote 1"
[What would we have without libraries?
We don't have a past or a future.
(./create static lib.sh):
Make a script that compiles all of the.c files in the current directory into a library called liball.a. 
Remember this when developing a static library: ###


gcc -c *.c transforms.c files into.o (object) files.

Arcs libmy.a *.o

Arc libmy.a *.o
By doing this, "Libmy.a" static library is created.

Ar-t libmy.a
Below is a list of every file in libmy.a.


- converted to random library using ranlib libmy.a


- If you wish to compile a static library for testing purposes after developing it:

- > main.c gcc -std=gnu89
-L -lmy -o
(new file name)
